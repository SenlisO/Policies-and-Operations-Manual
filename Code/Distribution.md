# Distribution
Any code written for Drauger OS may be distributed to, for, and on, other platforms, however anyone wishes; provided the following stipulations are met. These guidelines are less binding than the GPL license used on our code, but we strongly recommend following them in order to help improve the community.

1. **The code distributed is distributed in good faith**, with no malicious code of any sort (malware, backdoors, spyware, analytics which unknowingly collects users data, etc.) patched in.

2. **The code is not being distributed to users already on Drauger OS.** If you wish an update to be issued to a bit of software on Drauger OS, please request it instead of packaging the code and spreading it yourself and risking breakage of other user's systems.

3. **Credit is given to the original authors of the code in question.** We encourage you to take credit for any changes you make, but please also give credit to original authors of code which you do not create yourself.


We also REQUEST that the following points also be exercised:

1. **Notify Drauger OS Contributors of the redistribution.** We are curious to know what all platforms our code runs on, and want to make sure all users of it have an enjoyable experience. Knowing at least SOMEONE is using our code on another platform can help inform us and push us to improve our code on other platforms.
2. **Contribute back to the original code.** If you see a change that can improve the experience for others using our code, please make the change and include it in a pull request.
