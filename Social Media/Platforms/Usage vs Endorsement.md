# Usage vs Endorsement
Usage of a Platform does NOT indicate endorsement of that Platform or its practices. Usage of a Platform comes about from a complex weighing of multiple factors including, but not limited to (in decreasing order of importance(most important first)):

 * Platform Population (how many people use the platform, including federation with other platforms)
 * Is there topic segregation? (see the segment on topic segregation for more info)
 * How comfortable our Contributors feel with the Platform
 * Platform Image (see the segment on Platform Image for more info)
 * Is the Platform FOSS?
 
If a given Platform meets at least 2 of the above criteria, then the chances of us being open to a platform are reasonably high. Of course, there is never a guarantee of us using any platform. This is due to things such as allocation of man power and the opinion of the overall community on the platform.
