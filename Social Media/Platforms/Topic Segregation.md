# Topic Segregation
Topic segregation a feature some Platforms have which allows the creation and management of spaces where conversations pertaining to a specific topic can take place. Examples of these spaces can be Sub-Reddits on Reddit, or channels in a Discord server.

There are two forms of topic segregation:

## Hard Segregation
Hard segregation is like the first two examples provided above: clear, intentionally created areas on a Platform which foster conversation around a specific topic. While off-topic conversation can, and likely will, happen inside this area, it can be moderated to follow a specific set of rules within this area.

We tend to prefer this form of segregation, as the segregation of topics is more clear and moderators can exercise real, formal powers such as kicking, banning, or muting users, deleting messages, or otherwise exercising the administrative powers provided to them by the Platform and Drauger OS Administration.

## Soft Segregation
Soft segregation is like the last example provided above: a more amorphous group of people who congregate together naturally through either a common interest and similar friends, or a less amorphous group who are brought together based on their perceived interests by an algorithm.

We often do not like this form of segregation. While nice in its own way, it does not provide the features or power necessary. Moderation in these areas is very difficult because of those missing features. Meaning, any sort of rules or moderation would have to be exercised on a more informal level, and no real consequences can be imposed outside those that are social in nature (such as a ruined reputation, or ostracization). In these instances, moderators would only have power based on their standing as a natural leader in a community. Kicking or banning users is purely a social construct in this situation, with no real implications. Any bad actor who is determined enough could easily jump in and wreak all sorts of havoc if they so choose.
