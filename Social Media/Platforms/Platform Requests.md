# Appealing/Requesting Platform Usage/Adoption

## Applying for Platform Adoption
1. **Request a Platform to be adopted.**

	This can be done by any Drauger OS Contributor, through any way of contacting us. However, the following info is needed for further processing:
	
	1. Platform URL
	2. Reasons to adopt the Platform in question
	3. Platform Population (a rough estimate is acceptable)
	4. Presence of Topic Segregation
	5. Is the Platform FOSS?
	6. Whether the applicant is willing to manage the account on this platform themselves.

2. **CCT Discussion, possible larger Community Vote**

	The CCT has first say on whether we should use this platform or not.
	
	* If the CCT has a 2/3 majority vote _for_ using the new Platform, then the new Platform is adopted.
	* If the CCT has a 2/3 majority vote _against_ using the new Platform, then the new Platform is _not_ adopted.
	* In all other cases, a poll will be posted to the larger Drauger OS Community as a whole. A simple majority of _ALL_ votes decides whether the new Platform will be adopted or not. 
		* In the unlikely event of a tie, the default will be _NOT_ adopting the new Platform.

3. **Once a new Platform is adopted, a Platform Manager is Assigned.**

	Platform Managers are the person on our Social Media Team in charge of that Platform. If the Applicant is willing to manage the new Platform, they become the new Platform Manager for that Platform.

## Appealing Platform Usage
1. **Request a Platform be dropped.**

	This can be done by any Drauger OS Contributor, through any way of contacting us.
	
	Accusations of actions on the Platform in question, such as fostering extremist views, negligent moderation, or a questionable Platform Image requires concrete evidence with the burden of evidence placed on the Applicant. Evidence reliability will be determined by the CCT, during the next step.
	
2. **CCT Discussion, possible larger Community Vote**

	The CCT has first say on whether we should use this platform or not.
	
	During this discussion, 3 things will be discussed:
	
	* **Evidence Reliability**
		* This includes Evidence type, source, and age
	* **Evidence Volume**
		* How much evidence is there?
	* **Evidence Severity**
		* Essentially, how large of a claim is the evidence?
		* With greater severity, Evidence Volume and Reliability needs to increase as well. Remember:
			`"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" -- Carl Sagan`
			
	If the CCT deems there is not enough reliable evidence to make a vote, the process ends here, and no changes are made. Otherwise the following is practiced:
	
	* If the CCT has a 2/3 majority vote _for_ using the Platform, then the Platform is stays in use.
	* If the CCT has a 2/3 majority vote _against_ using the Platform, then the Platform is dropped and our account on it deleted.
	* In all other cases, a poll will be posted to the larger Drauger OS Community as a whole. A simple majority of _ALL_ votes decides whether the Platform will be dropped or not. 
		* In the unlikely event of a tie, the default will be _NOT_ dropping the new Platform.
