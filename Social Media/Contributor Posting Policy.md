# Contributor Posting Policy
Per the Content Policy, all Contributors are expected to follow our Community Guidelines, alongside a further rule-set made specifically for contributors. Our guidelines can be found at:[Community Guidelines](https://draugeros.org/go/wiki/community-guidelines/).

The additional rules Contributors are expected to follow on social media:

1. **Controversial topics including but not limited to things such as religion, politics, and ethics (outside those which directly affect Drauger OS and its community) shall *NOT* be posted about on any of Drauger OS's platforms by any Contributor.**

	While we at Drauger OS Development wish to support free speech, when doing work on a Drauger OS social media account, or performing moderation duties on platforms such as Reddit, Discord, Telegram, or our Forums, all Contributors are to remain strictly neutral in all controversial matters. This should be exercised to the extent of preventing any uncivil discourse and maintaining the image of Drauger OS as strictly apolitical, secular, and otherwise uninvolved in all matters controversial which do not directly affect Drauger OS.
		
	While a Contributor is posting on their personal accounts outside of the Drauger OS Forums, and/or is off of Drauger OS platforms and not performing moderation duties, any and all Contributors are free to express their own, personal views however they see fit. This DOES NOT indicate endorsement of any particular Contributors views.
		
2. **Sharing/Re-posting of topics on Drauger OS platforms should be limited** to programming, Linux, or gaming-related topics.
	
3. **Contributors should _NEVER_ post anything defamatory about _ANY_ other software project**, no matter how good or bad it is.

	While it is plain for all to see that we at Drauger OS Development are very against Windows and MacOS, posting anything overly negative about another project is not only immature, it also projects a negative image on us as well. Developers put hard work into whatever code they write, and that should be respected, no matter how bad it is. Instead, follow this simple rule:

		"If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."
