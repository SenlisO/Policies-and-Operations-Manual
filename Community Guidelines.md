# Community Guidelines
1. Be respectful of **all** users

2. Keep the chats and servers SFW (Safe For Work) (No nudity/pornography or links to such content). Light profanity usage is okay. However, please keep it to a minimum for the underage people in our community.

3. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes in when direct/private messaging fellow members.

4. No illegal content

5. Designated chat threads, channels, or rooms, may be used for discussing anything anyone wants to talk about, provided it follows the above rules. This includes off-topic content.

6. Nicknames, where they are freely changeable, are subject to the same moderation rules as messages are (Rules 1, 2, and 4)

7. Do not direct or private message anyone unless provided explicit permission to message an individual, by the individual in question.

8. When posting an Xfce Panel Profile, please include:
   * The Profile file itself (Can be obtained from the Panel Profiles menu in Settings)
   * A screenshot of the Panel Profile
   * The name of the Panel Profile (If not for debugging proposes) (It's suggested to name the file the same thing as the Profile)
   * Please keep Panel Profiles in threads or channels named "xfce-panel-profiles" unless it is for support, debugging, or development purposes.
   * Panel Profile names and screenshots are subject to the same moderation rules as messages (Rules 1, 2, and 4).
  
9. When entering a server, chat room, etc, with roles, please ping the "admin" role and let them know whether you use Drauger OS, are interested in contributing in some fashion, are looking for more information, or something else.

	This is not to discourage you from joining the server. This is to attempt to weed out bots, and provide real people with whatever role suites them best as soon as they enter the server.
	
10. _The below is less of a rule and more of a note._

	Roles are designated for each of the following groups of people. Some people fit in multiple groups and thus have multiple roles.

	**users** : Users of any Drauger OS version, whether that be in a VM for testing, or using it for gaming on a daily basis, or something completely different.

	**beta-testers** : People who run beta versions of Drauger OS, or test otherwise code that is beta or alpha level to help with testing. Typically these users are a little more familiar with the system as they are more likely to have to dig to find logs or fix bugs.

	**devs** : Developers of any software used by Drauger OS

	**translators** : Translators who help translate Drauger OS apps from English into whatever other language.

	**admin** : Administrators/Moderators/Core Team Members, these are the people who have made a profound impact on Drauger OS for the better and work to help us improve. They are often very knowledgeable about the system, and (usually) contribute often.

	**editors** : People who edit or write any of our documentation or other literature for clarity and accuracy, or just simply fix the human's grammar and spelling. üòù

	**moderators** : Self-explanatory. 

	If it is deemed that an assigned role is not suitable for a user, that role may be revoked for both security and organizational reasons. Furthermore, roles may be revoked as a precursor to kicking or banning a user if disciplinary action is deemed necessary.
