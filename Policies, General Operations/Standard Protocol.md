# Policy for Adopting, Repealing, and Amending other Policies, and making General Decisions (a.k.a. Standard Protocol)

1. **Draft Phase**

	During this phase, any Contributor may draft up a policy or change to a policy. They should gain the approval for policy or change from at least one (1) other Contributor before proceeding onto the next Phase.
	
2. **Presentation Phase**

	After the Draft Phase, any approving Contributor may present the policy or change to the CCT by creating a thread in the cct-text channel. This presentation requires 2 parts: sharing of the new policy or change, and a time to answer questions to create clarification.
	
3. **CCT Debate and Deliberation**

	At this point, the CCT will discuss the new policy or change. If changes are requested for clarification, coverage, or some other reason, then the new policy or change is sent back to the Draft Phase for those changes to be made by the original presenting group of Contributors, and any wishing to help or oversee the process.
	
	Next phase is achieved when one member proposes a vote and a member seconds.
	
4. **CCT Vote**
	* If the CCT has a 2/3 majority vote _for_ the new policy or change, then it is enacted.
	* If the CCT has a 2/3 majority vote _against_ the new policy or change, then it is _NOT_ enacted.
	* The new policy or change may not be resubmitted for 30 days regardless of rewording or changes made to the policy idea.
	  * If the policy is resubmitted before the allocated time, it will be dismissed and no vote recast will be made, regardless of how it is worded or altered at submission. 
	* If there is no 2/3 majority, then the new policy or change goes back to the Debate Phase.
		* This can happen a MAXIMUM of 3 times. If this maximum is reached, then the new policy or change is presented to the CPM who makes the final decision with one of the 4 possible options:
			* Approval
			* Rejection
			* Sending back to the Draft Phase (counter DOES NOT reset)
			* Presentation to the Drauger OS Community for Approval or Rejection, defaulting to Rejection in the case of a tie

5. **Closing**

	Members initiate closing a thread by a member proposing and another seconding.  The CCT will then vote and, if a majority agrees, the thread is closed.
