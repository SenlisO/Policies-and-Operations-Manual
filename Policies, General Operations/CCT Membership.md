# CCT Membership

## Joining
All CCT Members (except the first CCT) must go through the following process yearly in order to remain on the CCT.

1. **Candidacy**

	Contributors may attain Candidacy via 2 methods:

	* Contributors Page Recognition and Persistent Activity
		
		A Contributor who is recognized on the Contributor's page, and has been active for at least 3 months is immediately a Candidate for the next step.
		
	* Nomination
		
		A Contributor who gets Nominated by at least two (2) of their peers, and has been active for at least 3 months, qualifies as a Candidate for the next step.
		
2. **Primary Election**

	_If there are 4 or fewer Candidates, this step may be skipped._
	
	A Primary Election should be held, where the Candidates with greater than 30% of all votes proceed onto the next step. Voters may vote multiple times, the number of votes castable by each voter equal to 1/2 the number of Candidates, if more than 6 Candidates are running.
	
3. **Secondary Election**
	
	A Secondary Election should be held, where all Candidates with more than 50% of the vote are granted CCT positions. Voters may vote multiple times, the number of votes castable by each voter equal to 1/2 the number of Candidates, if more than 6 Candidates are running.
	
4. **Tertiary Election**
	
	_Should only be used if fewer than 5 Candidates are elected._
	
	In a Tertiary Election, all Candidates with more than 50% of the vote are granted CCT positions. Candidates granted CCT positions in the previous vote do not run in this Election. Voters may vote multiple times, the number of votes castable by each voter equal to 1/2 the number of Candidates, if more than 6 Candidates are running.
	
5. **Confirmation**

	After all Elections are complete, the CCT position should be formally offered to those who won them in the previous Elections.
	
	A Candidate who has won a position has the right to turn the position down if they so chose. However, if a Candidate declines the position, leaving fewer than 5 accepting Candidates, the entire process must be repeated.
	
	In a Repeat Election, Candidates who have already won a CCT position need not re-run, as their position is safe. Furthermore, the Declining Candidate may not re-run for a CCT position until the next yearly CCT Election.

## Leaving
There are two (2) ways in which a Contributor can voluntarily leave the CCT.

1. **Resignation**

	Any Contributor on the CCT may voluntarily resign from their position. No reason has to be given (although it is strongly recommended), and the CCT must acknowledge the Contributor's resignation. Rejections of resignations are strictly disallowed.

2. **Inactivity**

	Any Contributor may "ghost" the CCT to voluntarily resign from their position. This is not advised, however, as it takes 3 months to take affect.

## Maintaining Membership
Maintaining Membership of the CCT requires Contributors to follow the below points:

* **Remain Active**

	If a Contributor is not active for at least 3 months, and there is no prior notice of a Leave of Absence, then the Contributor will assume to forfeit their position on the CCT.

* **Uphold the Community Guidelines and Contributor Posting Policy, and CCT Code of Conduct**

	If a Contributor violates either the Community Guidelines, Contributor Posting Policy, or CCT Code of Conduct, and the infraction is severe enough, the CCT, or (if Executive Action has been invoked) the CPM, may revoke a Contributor's membership in the CCT.
	
	Determination of the necessity of this course of action, based on the severity of the infraction, falls upon either the CCT, or (if Executive Action has been invoked) the CPM.

* **Remain in otherwise good standing with the Drauger OS Community and the other Contributors**

	All Contributors in the CCT must be viewed favorably by the Drauger OS Community. If the Drauger OS Community or the Contributor Community demands the removal of a Contributor from the CCT, then the will of the people must be followed.
	
	In this instance, Standard Protocol should be followed, and the Contributor in question does not have the right to participate in these proceedings (but they may spectate), unless invited to participate and the invitation is approved by the CPM or ACPM. This invitation _DOES NOT_ extend voting rights to the Contributor in question.
	

### Loss of a Member
If the CCT loses a member, that member MUST be replaced if the CCT drops below 3 members. To do this, follow standard CCT Election protocol, without removing any currently seated CCT Member. 

Any newly elected CCT member will remain in office until the next election was supposed to be, pre-loss of member. Make sure to make it aware anyone elected will have a reduced time in office.
