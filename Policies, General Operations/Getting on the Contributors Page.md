# Getting on the Contributors Page
To get onto the Contributors Page, one must have been working with Drauger OS for at least a month, and has contributed at least 10 commits either to our website, to one of our GitHub repositories, in major beta-testing attempts, or some combination thereof.

Contributors are responsible for tracking their own contributions and providing evidence of them.
