# Replacing the CPM or ACPM
Replacing the CPM or ACPM may become necessary if they go rogue, they decide to leave the Project, they voluntarily step down, or if they happen to die, among other possible situations.

For the remainder of this sub-section, the remaining person in the position of either CPM or ACPM will be referred to as the Remaining Leading Contributor (RLC).

## Pre-Replacement

1. **Temporary Appointment**

	Within 6 hours of the incident becoming known to them, the RLC is to appoint a temporary successor (TS). The TS is to perform all the actions and duties of their new, temporary post. However, they do not have the power of Executive Action.
	
2. **Incident Assessment**

	Over the course of the next week, the CCT, RLC, and TS are to evaluate the the incident (if any) and determine what, if any, changes need to be made to Drauger OS to prevent this incident from happening again. They should also work with whoever necessary to get credentials to accounts, and have ownership of online organizations and the like moved to the RLC. 
	
3. **TS Reassignment**

	At the end of the week, the CCT should go through the standard process to either cement the TS into their new position and grant them the power of Executive Action, or replace them with a better-suited candidate.

## Special Considerations

### Death
In the event the CPM or ACPM dies, the RLC should appoint a temporary successor from Contributors within the CCT, using the power of Executive Action. Afterward, _ALL_ CCT and development work shall halt for one (1) week, to show respect for those who were lost, and allow their friends and family time to mourn.

This one (1) week pause does _NOT_ contribute to the time limit in which a new CPM/ACPM must be elected, meaning that this time limit is measured from when this pause ends onward.

### Going Rogue
In the event the CPM or ACPM goes rogue, the RLC should appoint a temporary successor from Contributors within the CCT, using the power of Executive Action. Afterwards, still using Executive Action, the RLC has the duty to eject the rogue leader from the CCT, strip them of all credentials, and, if necessary, ban them from the Drauger OS Community altogether. The newly appointed successor may assist in this process if necessary.

#### Determining if someone has "gone rogue"

1. **Gather Evidence**
 
	All relevant evidence should be gathered, in as respectful and ethical a manner as possible.
 
2. **Call a CCT Meeting**

	Call a CCT meeting. Minimum of 2/3 of members must be present.
	
3. **Present the evidence**

	Present all evidence, with **NO MODIFICATION** to the CCT so that it can be reviewed as objectively as possible.
	
4. **Standard Protocol Vote**

	Follow the voting procedures laid out in Standard Protocol, with this sole modification:

	If a vote fails, there is no second attempt, and the person in question is acquitted of their crimes.

## Selecting the Replacement
1. **Eligibility**
	
	Any Replacement must meet the following criteria:
	
	* **Contributor Page Placement**
	
		A possible Replacement must have made it onto the Contributor Page [found here](https://draugeros.org/go/our-contributors/).
		
	* **Senior Contributor**
	
		A possible Replacement must be considered a Senior Contributor (have been contributing for at least 6 months).
		
	* **Minimum Age**
	
		A possible Replacement must be at least 21 years of age to ensure legal liability and maturity.
		
2. **Nomination**

	Once those eligible have been announced, someone must nominate an individual to allow them to run for the open position.
	
	Only one (1) nomination is necessary. Self-nomination is not allowed. Nominations may be declined.
	
3. **Voting**

	When electing a replacement CPM/ACPM, the rules for a CCT Vote from Standard Protocol are followed, but with the Vote being redone up to 3 times (eliminating those with less than 1/3 of all votes) if no victor can be decided. If after 3 times no victor can be decided, the election is posted to the Drauger OS Community, with all relevant info to inform their decision in voting. And AMA on Reddit or YouTube may be done if it helps the community.
