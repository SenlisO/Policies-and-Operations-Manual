# CCT Code of Conduct

All CCT Members are expected to follow the [Community Guidelines](https://draugeros.org/go/wiki/community-guidelines/), as well as the Contributor Posting Policy. However, CCT members are held in high esteem by the Community, and therefore more is expected of them.

Violation of this Code of Conduct by any CCT Member may result in their position on the CCT being revoked.

1. **Refrain from using any and all Financial or other Monetary Influence.**

	Some CCT Members may be more fortunate than others. Leveraging that fact against Users, Contributors, or fellow CCT members in order to obtain a certain outcome is not only disrespectful, it's also rude. 
	
2. **Refrain from offering sexual favors, or threatening with sexual action**

	Consent is part of respect. And as Rule #1 of the Community Guidelines is about respect, exercising these actions is strictly against that rule.
	
	Furthermore, the Drauger OS Community is not a place for sexual anything. Any consenting pair of adults involved with Drauger OS should keep their relationship of out of their work here and encourage others to do the same.
	
	This rule DOES NOT forbid fraternization with fellow Contributors. Only involving that fraternization with Drauger OS work and the Community.
	
3. **Be aware, minors are often in chat.**

	As a high-ranking member of the Drauger OS Community, it is imperative you keep conversation and debate Safe-For-Work as much as possible. This is especially true in voice and video chats during cooperative or competitive game play.
	
4. **Before committing Drauger OS to a partnership with another Project, present the proposal to the CCT**

	As a partnership is a large undertaking, make sure that if you are offered a proposal to partner Drauger OS with another project, that you present the proposal to the CCT first before accepting.
