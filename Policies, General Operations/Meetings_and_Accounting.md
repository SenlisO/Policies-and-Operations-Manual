# Meetings

Instead of meetings, communications will happen continuously in the cct-text channel.  CCT members are expected to check the channel and threads and communicate daily as required.  

##### Proposals

Proposals changing the Policies and Operations Manual will be made through a pull request in Github.

An action item is a proposal that is not intended to be permanent addition to the Policies and Operations Manual, but rather actions to be taken by an individual or group.

Any action items should have a person assigned to it and an expected finish date set.  The purpose of this requirement is so it is clear who is working on it and when we can expect it to be finished (or at least an update).

All proceedings in threads will follow the guidelines the the standard protocol section.

##### President

The President position is fullfilled primarily by the CPM and secondarily by the ACPM.

##### Secretary position

This policy enacts the position of Secreatary.  The secretary will track threads and update the president on their status.  Updates will include proposals and action items that are lacking progress and when action items have due dates that have passed.  Overall, the secretary is assisting the president to keep on-track with the proposals and action items.

The secretary will create a report quarterly to show, at a minimum, thread creation date, completion date, and summary.  The report will also include any time executive action is used and for what purpose.  These reports will be presented to the Drauger OS channel in Discord.

# Finances

##### Summary

The finances of the project should be handled by the CCT and be transparent to the community.  Basic accounting concepts will be employed and at a minimum include double entry and cash basis accounting.

##### Treasurer

This policy enacts the CCT position of Treasurer.  The Treasurer is in charge of tracking and reporting the projects finances.  The Treasurer will be familiar with basic concepts of accounting.

Treasurer are elected using the same process as CCT positions.  The only difference is that the position will have a new election whenever the position is vacant or in July (The exception is if a Treasurer was voted in after January 1st the same year).  The Treasurer must be a member of the CCT team.

##### Spending

The CCT team is in charge of determining spending priorities.  This will be accomplished by enacting policies/action items per the meeting section of the Policies and Opearations Manual.  The Treasurer will not make purchases to ensure separation of duties.

##### Continuity

Accounting documentation should be stored in a location agreed upon upon the CCT members and ammended to this paragraph.  That location should be accessable by the CPM and ACPM and will be backed up.

In that same location, the Treasurer will collect continuity documents that explain current accounting operations and basic accounting principles for the time when another takes his place as Treasurer.

##### Transparency

The community should know what contributions to the project is being spent on and should be re-assured that contributions are not being embezzeled by project members.  Towards that end, quarterly reports will be made available to the community.  The quarterly reporting periods are:
- January through March
- April through June
- July through September
- October though December.
The reports are due by the end of the month following the quarterly reporting period.  Annual reports are due by the end of January.

Reports will be stored with the accounting documentation and posted in the news channel in Discord and on Telegram.
