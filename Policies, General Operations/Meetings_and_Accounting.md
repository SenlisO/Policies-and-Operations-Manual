# Meetings

##### Summary

The CCT will have meetings monthly.  This is to encourage participation in decision making and prevent complacency, apathy or maintaining the status quo.  

Meetings will be scheduled in a way that allows maximum participation with the CPM, ACPM and CCT.  However, meetings will not be conducted without a quorum.  A quorum is 50% of the total number of CPM, ACPM and CCT members in the meeting (rounded up).  Meetings will be scheduled for the 2nd or 3rd week of the month, unless that week is not suitable for all members to attend (or at least a quorum), at which time the meeting will be scheduled each week following until at least a quorum is obtained.  The default meeting time and date will be the 2nd Thursday of the month at 9:00 PM Eastern time zone

Note: A new meeting frequency, quorum rules, or scheduling rules can be obtained by ammending this policy per the Policies and Opearations Manual: Policies, General Operations section

##### Meeting agenda

Meetings will discuss, at a minimum:
1) Old business (including previous policies in presentation phase)
2) New business (including new policies in presentation phase)
3) Financial summary
4) Community quorum
5) CCT session (CCT, CPM and ACPM only)
	CCT session will only discuss matters not appropriate for the entire community, specifically those that pertain to a member of the community.

Suggested topics of conversation include (in no particular order):
- How to reach more users
- The current state of the project
- The future of the project
- Breaches of the policies and operations manual and community guidelines and remedial actions that need to be taken or has been taken
- Action items that have been resolved, and which need to be removed
- How to raise more money for the project
- How money is being spent

Any action in the meeting will have motion and will have a second.  This includes starting the meeting and finishing the meeting.

##### Venue

The venue for the meetings will be discord audio chat for all members.  CCT members are expected to have speakers and microphone available, but it is understood that not all circumstances permit audio meetings.  Therefore, any member can use the chat component if necessary.

If a potential atendee informs the CCT, CPM or ACPM that they do not want to use Discord due to its proprietary nature, the meeting will be held on Mumble.

##### Proposals

Proposals changing the Policies and Operations Manual will be in the presentation phase and presented to the CCT 1 week before the meeting.  The proposal will be voted upon at the meeting in accordance with the Policies and Opearations Manual: Policies, General Operations section.

An action item is a proposal that is not intended to be permanent addition to the Policies and Operations Manual, but rather actions to be taken by and individual or group.  Action items brought up during the meeting will have a motion and a second.  Those action items will be voted upon at the meeting in accordance with the Policies and Opearations Manual: Policies, General Operations section.  These action items will be added to an appendix to the Policies and Operations Manual and will be removed when the action is completed.

It is recommended that action items are written up as a proposal and follow the proposal process to be presented to the CCT a week before the meeting.

Any action items should have a person assigned to it and an expected finish date set.  The purpose of this requirement is so it is clear who is working on it and when we can expect it to be finished (or at least an update).

##### President

The President position in a meeting is fullfilled by the CPM, ACPM, or designated representative.  This person leads the meeting.  If the meeting can't be presided over by the CPM, ACPM, or someone designated by them, the meeting will be rescheduled.

##### Secretary position

This policy enacts the position of Secreatary.  The Secretary will take notes during the meeting, create minutes, and present those minutes in the CCT channel.  Minutes from the CCT session will be redacted.  CCT session items will be publicised after fix-actions have been completed and will summarize the action and why it was taken.  The Secreatary will prepare these notices and post them in the news channel within 2 weeks of the action being taken.

Secretaries are elected using the same process as CCT positions.  The only difference is that the position will have a new election whenever the position is vacant or in July (The exception is if a secratary was voted in after January 1st the same year).  The Secretary must be a member of the CCT team.

# Announcement of Contibutor positions

Note: this is an action item

##### Summary

The contribution page currently does well at giving credit to who has contributed significantly to the project, but doesn't do well at describing who has was position in managing DraugerOS.  The contributor page will have a summary at the top which includes a summary of the ACPM, the CPM, CCT members (including sub positions), as well as other core contribution positions such as developers, web designers, and moderators.  This will give anyone who looks a quick summary on who they should contact for specific input (and who isn't Batcastle all the time)

# Finances

##### Summary

The finances of the project should be handled by the CCT and be transparent to the community.  Basic accounting concepts will be employed and at a minimum include double entry and cash basis accounting.

##### Treasurer

This policy enacts the CCT position of Treasurer.  The Treasurer is in charge of tracking and reporting the projects finances.  The Treasurer will be familiar with basic concepts of accounting.

The only difference is that the position will have a new election whenever the position is vacant or in July (The exception is if a Treasurer was voted in after January 1st the same year).  The Treasurer must be a member of the CCT team.

##### Spending

The CCT team is in charge of determining spending priorities.  This will be accomplished by enacting policies/action items per the meeting section of the Policies and Opearations Manual.  The Treasurer will not make purchases to ensure separation of duties.

##### Continuity

Accounting documentation should be stored in a location agreed upon upon the CCT members and ammended to this paragraph.  That location should be accessable by the CPM and ACPM and will be backed up.

In that same location, the Treasurer will collect continuity documents that explain current accounting operations and basic accounting principles for the time when another takes his place as Treasurer.

##### Transparency

The community should know what contributions to the project is being spent on and should be re-assured that contributions are not being embezzeled by project members.  Towards that end, quarterly reports will be made available to the community.  The quarterly reporting periods are:
- January through March
- April through June
- July through September
- October though December.
The reports are due by the end of the month following the quarterly reporting period.  Annual reports are due by the end of January.
