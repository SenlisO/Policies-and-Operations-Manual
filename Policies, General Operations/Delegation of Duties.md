# Delegation of Duties

In some instances, it may be necessary to delegate large duties to others so that they may work more autonomously. This can provide smoother performance down the chain in fixing bugs and adding minor features, and remove some of the load off the CCT.

When delegating an entire application or product to someone, the following template can be used.


## Template for Delegation of Duties


### Delegation Of <Duty\> to <Contributor Name\>

This document hereby delegates <duty\> to <contributor name\> (the Contributor), with <supervisor name\> (the Supervisor) as their direct supervisor within the CCT.

#### Granted Powers
These are the powers and capabilities that are henceforth granted to the Contributor in order to perform their duty to the best of their ability.

 * <List all granted powers here. Be sure to only grant what is necessary to perform the job autonomously in most situations\>
 
#### Limitations
These are the limitations imposed on the Contributor in the name of safety. These limitations do not indicate any lack of trustworthiness. Instead, they provide an opportunity to bring up larger issues with those who need to know about them.

	* <List things that the contributor CANNOT do here. Make sure to be general so that your bases are covered.\>
	
In addition to these limitations, it is requested that the Contributor keep track of major changes and issues and report them to the Supervisor, or directly to the CCT in the Supervisor's absence, at least once a month.

#### Violation of Limitations

In the event the Contributor violates their limitations, without direct, prior, written approval from either the Supervisor, the CCT, or the CPM (if Executive Action has been invoked), the Contributor submits to have all Granted Powers stripped from them. Furthermore, this Delegation is rendered null and void and is only preserved for record keeping purposes.
